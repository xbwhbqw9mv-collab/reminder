# SwiftUI Reminders App (Learning Project)

This project is my hands-on introduction to SwiftUI, built by deconstructing the interface of Apple's official Reminders app. 
The goal was to translate Apple's HIG principles into code,and how a modern, data-driven app is built, focusing on layout, state, and modular components.
This app is built "interface-first" and does not include navigation or data persistence.
This project was a self-assigned challenge to answer the question: "How do I build a real app's interface?" 
I chose the Reminders app because it's the perfect example of Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) in action, using complex layouts, grids, and layered UI.
This project was my first time truly understanding these fundamental SwiftUI principles.
After encountering some bugs and challenges with multi-page navigation, I decided to focus entirely on perfecting a single-page interface to master the core components.
